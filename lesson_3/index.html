          Four of the most exciting smartphones of 2023 have now arrived, with <mark>Apple</mark> having unveiled the
          <mark>iPhone 15</mark>, the <mark>iPhone 15 Plus</mark>, the <mark>iPhone 15 Pro</mark>, and the <mark>iPhone
            15 Pro Max</mark>.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s a lot that’s changed this year, and you can head to our hands-on <mark>iPhone 15</mark> review,<mark>
            iPhone 15</mark> Pro review, and <mark>iPhone 15 Pro Max</mark> review to read our first impressions of
          those phones. But there are some clear highlights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below, you’ll find seven top new <mark>iPhone 15</mark> features – these are in many cases things that
          <mark>Apple</mark> has already shouted about, and in all cases they rank among the main reasons to consider
          picking up a phone in the <mark>iPhone 15</mark> line.

      <h2>1. An iPhone finally has a periscope camera</h2>

      <h6>

      </h6>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          Smartphone makers - other than Samsung - have been slow to adopt periscope cameras, which is a type of lens
          design that allows for longer distance optical zoom than a typical telephoto camera can manage.
        </p>
        <p>
          As such, while Samsung has been offering a 10x optical zoom on its Galaxy Ultra phones for several
          generations, <mark>Apple</mark> has stuck with 3x. That is, until now.
        </p>
        <p>
          While it still can&apos;t match Samsung&apos;s 10x optical zoom, the <mark>iPhone 15 Pro Max</mark> does at
          least have a 5x optical zoom camera, allowing you to zoom in much further than the 3x of its predecessor.
        </p>
        <p>
          This will be ideal for taking photos of animals, high-up parts of buildings, and other things you can&apos;t
          easily get close to.

      <h2>2. USB-C instead of Lightning</h2>
      <img src="img/3-iphone-charge.jpg" alt="Photo iPhone Charge port" width="500">
      <h6>

      </h6>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          Perhaps the most widely expected change for the <mark>iPhone 15</mark> line was the move to USB-C. The
          European Union had dictated that device makers must make this change in 2024, so it was always likely that
          <mark>Apple</mark> would get ahead of the game this year. But while this might not have been
          <mark>Apple&apos;s</mark> choice, USB-C is a top new feature.
        </p>
        <p>
          This switch means that you&apos;ll be able to use the same cable for most things since the best Android phones
          and the majority of other battery-powered gadgets use USB-C - as do recent iPads and MacBooks.
        </p>
        <p>
          USB-C also potentially allows for far higher data transfer speeds, though only the <mark>iPhone 15 Pro</mark>
          and <mark>iPhone 15 Pro Max</mark> tap into this, with support for 10Gbps speeds.
        </p>

      <h2>3. All four models get a Dynamic Island</h2>
      <img src="img/4-iphone-display.jpg" alt="Photo iPhone Display" width="500">
      <h6>

      </h6>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          Arguably the headline feature of the <mark>iPhone 14</mark> line was the Dynamic Island, which replaced the
          much-maligned notch with something genuinely useful and different. But this feature was originally exclusive
          to the Pro phones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now though, every <mark>iPhone 15</mark> model has a Dynamic Island, so you don&apos;t have to splash out on
          the <mark>iPhone 15</mark> Pro or <mark>iPhone 15 Pro Max</mark> to get this exciting upgrade.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>4. The Action button</h2>
      <img src="img/5-iphone-buttons.jpg" alt="Photo iPhone Buttons" width="500">
      <h6>
        The iPhone 15 Pro Max (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)
      </h6>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          One feature that&apos;s exclusive to the <mark>iPhone 15 Pro</mark> models is an Action button, which sits
          where you&apos;d previously have found the mute switch.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you just want to mute and unmute your phone like with the previous switch this can do that. But it&apos;s
          also customizable, so you can set it to trigger numerous other functions, such as turning the flashlight on
          and off, or launching the camera.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s a far more useful feature than the departing mute switch and it&apos;s the sort of thing that
          you&apos;ll wonder why it wasn&apos;t added years ago - and why the standard models are left out.
        </p>

      <h2>5. A big main camera upgrade for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus</h2>
      <img src="img/6-iphone-photo.jpg" alt="Photo iPhone photo" width="500">
      <h6>

      </h6>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          While the headline camera upgrade for the <mark>iPhone 15</mark> line is arguably the <mark>iPhone 15 Pro
            Max&apos;s</mark> periscope camera, the <mark>iPhone 15</mark> and <mark>iPhone 15 Plus</mark> also got a
          big upgrade, with a 48MP main sensor replacing the 12MP one of their predecessors.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is capable of taking far higher resolution photos than the camera on the <mark>iPhone 14</mark> and
          <mark>iPhone 14 Plus</mark>. <mark>Apple</mark> has claimed the photos taken with these new phones should be
          better in just about all scenarios, including for portraits and in low light environments.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>6. A telephoto camera without a telephoto lens</h2>
      <img src="img/7-iphone-camera-two.jpg" alt="Photo iPhone 15 camera" width="500">
      <h6>
        The iPhone 15 (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)
      </h6>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          Not only is the 48MP camera on the <mark>iPhone 15</mark> and <mark>iPhone 15 Plus</mark> an upgrade in
          megapixels, it also doubles as a telephoto camera, as it can crop in to take optical quality 2x zoom shots at
          12MP.
        </p>
        <p>
          That means for the first time on a non-Pro iPhone you effectively have three rear cameras, including a
          telephoto. Of course, technically it&apos;s still just two lenses, but this ups the versatility of the
          <mark>iPhone 15</mark>&apos;s camera significantly.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>7. A super-powerful new chipset</h2>
      <img src="img/8-iphone-processor.jpg" alt="Photo iPhone Processor a17Pro" width="500">

      </h6>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          While the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus have inherited the excellent A16 Bionic chipset from the iPhone 14 Pro
          line, there&apos;s something new powering the <mark>iPhone 15 Pro</mark> and <mark>iPhone 15 Pro Max</mark>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dubbed the A17 Pro, this is <mark>Apple</mark>&apos;s latest smartphone chipset, and it delivers up to 10%
          faster CPU performance, offers a 20% faster GPU, and even has the ability to drive hardware-accelerated ray
          tracing, which should deliver some impressive graphics in future iOS games. And the Neural Engine performance,
          which governs iPhone smart features, has been doubled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of those figures are more impressive than others. But a year after launch the A16 Bionic still easily
          rivals the best chipsets in Android phones, so the A17 Pro should be a real beast.
