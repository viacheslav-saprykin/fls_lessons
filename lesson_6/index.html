            Kyiv is the Capital of Ukraine Kyiv is one of the more beautiful and one of the oldest cities of Eastern Europe
            and has played a pivotal role in the development of the East Slavic civilization as well as in the modern
            Ukrainian nation. Founded 1500 years ago, Kyiv is the capital of Ukraine and Kyiv region. The name Kyiv is said
            to derive from the name of Kiy (also Kyi), one of four legendary founders of the city (brothers Kiy, Shchek,
            Khoryv, and sister Lybid). The legend is widely recognized as a source of Kyiv's mythology and, accordingly,
            urban naming. Kyiv was founded in the latter half of the 5th, or the early 6th century, and in 1982 its 1,500th
            anniversary was officially celebrated.
            Kiev or Kyiv? Currently, Kiev is the traditional and most commonly used English name for the city, but in 1995
            the Ukrainian government adopted Kyiv as the mandatory romanization for use in legislative and official acts.
            The U.S. Board of Geographic Names is a federal body that operates under the U.S. secretary of the interior. It
            has a mandate to standardize geographic names for official U.S. government business. In October 2006, the board
            approved the spelling Kyiv as one of the official standard forms of the Ukrainian capital. Kyiv is situated on
            the picturesque banks of the Dnieper river. It is one of the most beautiful cities of Europe. One half of Kyiv's
            territory is occupied by parks and gardens. One of the biggest cities of Europe, Kiev has a population of 3,14
            million and occupies an area of more than 840 square kilometres. Kyiv's most famous historical architecture
            complexes are the St. Sophia Cathedral, where the princes of Kiev were crowned in the years of Kiev's grandeur,
            and the Kiev Pechersk Lavra (Monastery of the Caves), has two 11th-century cathedrals on its grounds, in
            addition to its world-famous catacombs, which are recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.

            Also of interest are the ruins of the 11th-century Golden Gate, once the main entrance to the city. Kiev is the
            site of several universities, most notably the University of Kiev (founded in 1834). The Ukrainian Academy of
            Sciences and its Central Library, Ukraine is largest library, are located in Kiev. Kiev is a modern city with
            many monuments, more than 100 museums (including the National Museum of the History of Ukraine (1899), the
            National Museum of Natural History, the National Art Museum of Ukraine, Pirogovo), 33 theatres (including a
            Music Conservatory, National Opera of Ukraine), zoo and a large sports stadium. Being the largest city of
            Ukraine, Kyiv (Kiev) is a leading industrial and commercial center of the country. Kiev's major industries
            include: food processing (especially processing of beet sugar), metallurgy, manufacture of machinery, machine
            tools, rolling stock, chemicals, building materials, and textiles. The development of Ukrainian economy gave
            impulse to business activity of the city. There are a lot of new office centers, banks, trade exhibition centers
            and other commercial enterprises appearing in the city nowadays. Kiev is known as the most green city. The area
            of the green zone covers 43,600 hectares (making up 168 sq.m per one resident), more than half of which is taken
            up by woods, public gardens, two botanical gardens, parks and tree-lined boulevards. At the United Nations
            Climate Change Conference 2009 Kiev was the only CIS city to have been inscribed into the TOP30 European Green
            City Index. Kiev is served by a good transportation network. Trunk railways and all-weather roads link Kiev to
            Moscow, Kharkiv and the Donets Basin, southern and western Ukraine, and Poland. Within Kiev city itself there is
            efficient subway, rail, and bus service. The Dnieper River is navigable about nine months of the year, and Kiev
            is Boryspil airport operates flights to other Ukrainian cities and to cities in Europe, Asia, and North America.
