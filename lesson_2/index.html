          <mark>N</mark>ot all who wonder are lust. Some of us will be forming an orderly queue in
          the holding room at
          <br />
          One Apple Park Way on Tuesday morning. At 10 AM PT on September 12, Tim Cook and co.
          <br />
          will be back at it, showcasing the latest gear ahead of the big holiday push.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two things we can confidently tell you will be on display at the big Apple
          event: the
          <br />
          iPhone 15 and Apple Watch Series 9. There are some things in this world you can really set
          your
          <br />
          smartwatch to. There have been rumors galore, of course. For one thing, a few members of
          the
          <br />
          AirPods family are starting to get long in the tooth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Macs are a perpetual possibility as well. I think I also speak for most of us when I say
          that
          <br />
          it would be nice to get a little more face time with the Vision Pro headset that stole the
          show
          <br />
          at WWDC, back in June.
        </p>
        <p>
          What follows is a mix of what we know, what we think we know and what we&apos;re straight
          up
          <br />
          wildly speculating about.

        <p>
          The clear marquee announcement this time out. What&apos;s perhaps most interesting about
          the
          <br />
          iPhone 15 is that Apple had its hand forced here. It&apos;s not like anyone in the big
          glass spaceship
          <br />
          was champing at the bit to adopt USB-C (or Thunderbolt 3 or whatever you want to call it).
          <br />
          You can thank EU regulators for that one. Last year,
          <mark>the European Parliament</mark> voted to standardize <br />
          ports across devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, technically, those regulators gave manufacturers until the end of 2024 to implement
          <br />
          the tech across devices, but all signs point to Apple pulling off the Band-Aid for the
          iPhone 15. <br />
          Among other things, more regional governing bodies are poised to follow the EU&apos;s lead
          here
          <br />
          for consumer advocacy and e-waste related reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last September marked the 10th anniversary of Apple forcing the Lightning connector to be
          <br />
          a thing. The thing about Lightning, however, is that it&apos;s bad and I hate it. My
          colleagues hate <br />
          it. Friends and family hate it. My rabbit likes it, but she&apos;ll happily chew through
          any cable, <br />
          regardless of what&apos;s on either end. Point is, it&apos;s bad and has always been bad.
        </p>
        <p>
          An interesting caveat here is the report that the higher USB 3.2 data speed will be
          reserved
          <br />for the pro models, with the standard iPhone 15 stuck at USB 2.0 (still a common
          spec in <br />
          Android land).
        </p>
        <p>
          Wireless charging, meanwhile, is said to be bumped up to 35W across the board. It seems
          <br />
          the iPhone will be one of the first phones to adopt the Qi2 standard, which combines
          wireless <br />
          charging with magnets — something Apple has been doing for a minute. Given that Apple is
          one
          <br />
          of the 344 companies in the Wireless Power Consortium (and all of the Qi2 iPhone
          accessories
          <br />
          announced at IFA), this feels like a safe bet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, the Dynamic Island — introduced on the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max — should be
          <br />
          trickling down to the cheaper models as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another interesting addition is the rumored iPhone 15 Ultra, which would replace the Pro
          Max
          <br />
          and adopt Apple&apos;s recent naming convention. That handset is said to sport a 6.7-inch
          display
          <br />
          with a 120 Hz refresh rate, slimmed down bezels and the new “Action” button, which
          replaces
          <br />
          the long standard Mute. The new button — which is adopted from the Apple Watch Ultra
          <br />
          — would also grace the iPhone 15 Pro. It&apos;s said to offer a number of different
          customizable
          <br />
          shortcuts to things like the camera, accessibility options, flashlight and the actual
          Shortcuts <br />
          app (if you want to get creative).
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2 id="watch-series-9">Apple Watch Series 9</h2>
        <img
          src="/img/3.Apple-watch.jpg"
          width="600"

          alt="Photo with Apple Watch Series 9" />
        <p>
          Speaking of the Apple Watch. The rumor mill has actually been pretty silent here. That
          could
          <br />
          well be an indication that this is a relative down year for the wearable. It could also be
          due to <br />
          the fact that next year is the big 1-0, so Apple may wait until next year to pull out all
          the stops. <br />
          It&apos;s also likely waiting for next year for a new Apple Watch SE.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, a new Apple Watch Ultra does appear to be in the cards for next week. Both the
          <br />
          Ultra 2 and Series 9 are likely to get new processors and colors. There&apos;s also been
          <br />
          talk of Apple eyeing 3D printing for case design, after adopting the process for elements
          of the <br />
          Vision Pro. I do think there&apos;s still a big question of scale when comes to something
          as mass
          <br />
          market as the Apple Watch, however.
        </p>

        <h2 id="airpods">AirPods</h2>

        <p>
          The time feels right for some new AirPods. That said, 2024 seems a likelier timeline for
          the
          <br />
          headphones to get the H2 chip treatment. However, selling a stand-alone USB-C charging
          case
          <br />
          may be in the cards. And hey, speaking of overdue, it&apos;s been just under three years
          since we got <br />
          the AirPods Max. While we&apos;re at it, I wouldn&apos;t be mad at a new HomePod mini.

        <p>
          A better look at the Vision Pro seems almost certain. Content remains a big question mark,
          so
          <br />
          this could be a year of demos, seeing as how the “spatial computing” headset hits the
          market
          <br />
          early next year. We got virtually nothing in the way of games. Now that the SDK and
          Unity&apos;s
          <br />
          development platform have been out in the world for a minute, that seems like a distinct
          <br />
          possibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          More specifics on the iOS/macOS/iPadOS/watchOS release dates would make sense. <br />
          Macs, however, look like a bit more of a long shot this time out, and the M3 is far more
          <br />
          likely to arrive in 2024.
